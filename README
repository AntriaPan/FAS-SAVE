Instructions for how to run the experiment code
********************************************************************************

PREREQUISITES:

-- Until this step the steps are the same as the ones provided by the save guide.

--Instal simple-lib: pip2 install simple-pid
      

INSTRUCTIONS:

1) Copy any mp4 video in the folder mp4. We already provide one video there that has been encoded

2) To execute the PID controller is very similar to the other controllers. To use pid controller use:

     "./run.sh controller setpoint_ssim setpoint_size"
     
     "./run.sh pid setpoint_ssim setpoint_size"

   example: "./run.sh pid 0.9 50000" where 0.9 is the setpoint for the
   quality (ssim) and 50000 is the setpoint for the frame size
   
3) The tests results will be available in the directory results under
   a folder with the video name and a subfolder with the method name
   and the two given setpoints. We already provide results for all the controllers 
includin the PID.
